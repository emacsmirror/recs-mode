# recs - The [R]egular [E]xpression-based [C]ommand [S]uggester

Say you discover a new, more efficient sequence of commands to do
something.  You want to start using it, but your muscle memory
continues to do it the old way.  Before long you forget the new
way, and continue doing things the old way.  With recs, Emacs can
recognize the old pattern when you use it, and suggest the new the
pattern, training you to be a better Emacs user.

<tt>recs-mode</tt> is a simple command suggestion minor-mode.  It
works by recording the names of the commands you enter into a
ring-like string which is then matched against a list of
command-pattern regular expressions.  When a match is detected, recs
suggests a more efficient way of doing things.  recs looks strictly at
sequences of commands, not sequences of keystrokes, avoiding
complications resulting from different keybindings in different modes.

The advantage of this approach is that we can match any command
sequence that a regexp is powerful enough to match.

The disadvantage of this approach is that we can only match command
sequences that a regexp is powerful enough to match.

## Features

 - Definition of command patterns as standard Emacs regexps

 - Suggestions can be sent to the echo area or to another window.
   Having the window selected out from under you can get really
   annoying, making it desirable to learn quickly.

 - A timer to set the minimum interval between suggestions, per the
   Emacs TODO list <tt>C-h C-t</tt> guidelines.

 - A hook that's run whenever a match is detected. This can be used in
   conjunction with <tt>\`recs-suppress-suggestion'</tt> and
   <tt>\`recs-ding-on-suggestion'</tt> to define completely different
   behavior on match detection.

## Installation

 - put <tt>recs.el</tt> somewhere on your Emacs load path

 - add these lines to your <tt>.emacs</tt> file:

        (require 'recs)
        (recs-mode t)

## Configuration

 - recs comes with a number of default patterns, but you should modify
   these to fit your usage.  The default patterns are stored in the
   file <tt>recs-patterns</tt> in the recs directory.  You should copy
   that file somewhere sensible, like <tt>~/.emacs.d/</tt>, and
   customize it there.  You will need to set the value of
   <tt>recs-pattern-file</tt> to this new location:

        (setq recs-pattern-file "/path/to/new/recs-patterns")

   A recs pattern consists of a list containing a command sequence
   regular expression, a suggestion message, and any number of command
   name symbols:

        ("newline previous-line move-end-of-line"
         "You should use `open-line' to do that."
         open-line)

        ("\\(some-command \\| some-other-command \\)+newline yank"
         "You should use `better-command' or `even-better-command'
          to do that."
         better-command
         even-better-command)

   Commands listed in suggestions should be quoted like
   <tt>\`this'</tt>, allowing emacs' help system to link to its
   documentation.  recs will print the keybindings, if they exist, of
   the commands at the end of the list.  These should typically be the
   same ones that are <tt>\`quoted'</tt> in the suggestion message.

   After modifying the contents of <tt>recs-pattern-file</tt> you will
   need to reload the file for the changes to take effect.  You can do
   that either by toggling recs-mode off and on with two invocations
   of:

        M-x recs-mode

   or by issuing the command:

        M-x recs-load-pattern-file

 - Other customizable variables include:

        `recs-cmdstr-max'
        `recs-suggestion-interval'
        `recs-ding-on-suggestion'
        `recs-suggestion-window'
        `recs-window-select'
        `recs-hook'
        `recs-suppress-suggestion'
        `recs-log-file'
        `recs-log-suggestions'

   See the documentation for these variables in <tt>recs.el</tt>, or
   enter:

        C-u M-x customize-mode RET recs-mode RET
