;; Commentary:
;;
;; re-suggest.el is a simple command suggestion minor-mode. It works
;; by mapping commands to characters, creating a string out of the
;; character mappings of recent commands, matching the resulting
;; string against a list of user-defined regexps that correspond to
;; command sequences, and finally suggesting a better way to do things
;; when a match is found. re-suggest looks strictly at sequences of
;; commands, not sequences of keys, and so avoids most of the
;; complications resulting from different keybindings in different
;; modes. This is considered a feature.
;;
;; The advantage of this approach is that we can match any command
;; sequence that a regexp is powerful enough to match.
;;
;; The disadvantage of this approach is that we can only match any
;; command sequence that a regexp is powerful enough to match.

;; Installation:
;;
;;  - put `re-suggest.el' somewhere on your emacs load path
;;
;;  - add these lines to your .emacs file:
;;    (require 're-suggest)
;;    (re-suggest-mode t)
;;

;; Configuration:
;;
;;  - You'll need to set the mapping of commands to character strings
;;    to your liking. To do so, set the value of
;;    `re-suggest-cmd-char-alist' to an alist of command to
;;    character-string mappings like so:
;;
;;    (setq re-suggest-cmd-char-alist
;;      '((newline         . "l")
;;        (previous-line   . "p")
;;        (next-line       . "n")))
;;
;;  - You'll also need to set the mapping of command sequence regexps
;;    to suggestion messages. To do so, set the value of
;;    `re-suggest-regexp-cmd-seq-alist' to an alist of
;;    command-sequence-regexp to suggestion-message mappings like so:
;;
;;    (defvar re-suggest-regexp-cmd-seq-alist
;;      '(("lpe" . "You should use `open-line' to do that.")
;;        ("ov"  . "You should use `scroll-other-window' to do that.")))
;;
;;  - To set the maximum length of the command sequences re-suggest
;;    can recognize:
;;
;;    (setq re-suggest-cmd-string-length foo)
;;

;; TODO:
;;
;;  - Add a lot more suggestions. Use emacswiki's command suggestion
;;    page.
