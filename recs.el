;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Say you discover a new, more efficient sequence of commands to do
;; something.  You want to start using it, but your muscle memory
;; continues to do it the old way.  Before long you forget the new
;; way, and continue doing things the old way.  With recs, Emacs can
;; recognize the old pattern when you use it, and suggest the new the
;; pattern, training you to be a better Emacs user.
;;
;; recs.el is a simple command suggestion minor-mode.  It works by
;; recording the names of the commands you enter into a ring-like
;; string which is then matched against a list of command-pattern
;; regexps.  When a match is detected recs suggests a more efficient
;; way of doing things.  recs looks strictly at sequences of commands,
;; not sequences of keystrokes, avoiding complications resulting from
;; different keybindings in different modes.
;;
;; The advantage of this approach is that we can match any command
;; sequence that a regexp is powerful enough to match.
;;
;; The disadvantage of this approach is that we can only match command
;; sequences that a regexp is powerful enough to match.
;;

;;; Features:
;;
;;  - Definition of command patterns as standard Emacs regexps
;;
;;  - Suggestions can be sent to the echo area or to another window.
;;    Having the window selected out from under you can get really
;;    annoying, making it desirable to learn quickly.
;;
;;  - A hook that's run whenever a match is detected.
;;
;;  - A timer to set the minimum interval between suggestions, per the
;;    Emacs TODO list ("C-h C-t") guidelines.
;;
;;  - Togglable `ding'
;;

;;; Installation:
;;
;;  - put `recs.el' somewhere on your Emacs load path
;;
;;  - add these lines to your .emacs file:
;;    (require 'recs)
;;    (recs-mode t)
;;

;;; Configuration:
;;
;;  - recs comes with a number of default patterns, but you should
;;    modify these to fit your usage.  The default patterns are stored
;;    in the file "recs-patterns" in the recs directory.  You should
;;    copy that file somewhere sensible, like "~/.emacs.d/", and
;;    customize it there.  You will need to set the value of
;;    `recs-pattern-file' to this new location:
;;
;;      (setq recs-pattern-file "/path/to/new/recs-patterns")
;;
;;    A recs pattern consists of a list containing a command sequence
;;    regular expression, a suggestion message, and any number of
;;    command name symbols:
;;
;;      ("newline previous-line move-end-of-line"
;;       "You should use `open-line' to do that."
;;       open-line)
;;
;;      ("\\(some-command \\| some-other-command \\)+newline yank"
;;       "You should use `better-command' or `even-better-command'
;;        to do that."
;;       better-command
;;       even-better-command)
;;
;;    recs will print the keybindings, if they exist, of the commands
;;    at the end of the list.  The commands listed should typically be
;;    the same commands that are `quoted' in the suggestion message.
;;
;;    After modifying the contents of `recs-pattern-file' you will
;;    need to reload the file for the changes to take effect.  You can
;;    do this either by toggling recs-mode off and on with two
;;    invocations of:
;;
;;      M-x recs-mode
;;
;;    or by issuing the command:
;;
;;      M-x recs-load-pattern-file
;;
;;
;;  - Other customizable variables include:
;;
;;    `recs-cmdstr-max'
;;    `recs-suggestion-interval'
;;    `recs-ding-on-suggestion'
;;    `recs-suggestion-window'
;;    `recs-window-select'
;;    `recs-hook'
;;    `recs-suppress-suggestion'
;;    `recs-log-file'
;;    `recs-log-suggestions'
;;
;;    See the documentation for these variables below, or enter:
;;
;;      "C-u M-x customize-mode RET recs-mode RET"
;;

;;; TODO:
;;
;;   - More default suggestions
;;   - Interactive pattern definition
